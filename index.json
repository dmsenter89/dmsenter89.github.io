[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I’m a graduate student in applied mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill working in the Miller lab. I have broad interests in mathematical biology including fluid dynamics, biomechanics, and scientific computing. In particular, I\u0026rsquo;m currently working on passive flight behaviors in tiny insects.\nMy undergraduate was at the University of Utah. While a student there I was fortunate to work with Dr. Christel Hohenegger on modeling the motion of passive particles in complex fluids. That REU has helped cement my desire for graduate work, and resulted in my becoming a strong proponent of undergraduate involvement in research.\nIn my spare time I enjoy travelling, collecting books, watching scary movies, and reading nerdy webcomics. I’m also very interested in philosophy because I attended a humanist Gymnasium in Nuremburg, so my early education was in the tradition of Neuhumanismus.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://dmsenter89.github.io/author/d.-michael-senter/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/d.-michael-senter/","section":"authors","summary":"I’m a graduate student in applied mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill working in the Miller lab.
