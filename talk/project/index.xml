      <description>Summary IB2d and IBAMR are two software packages implementing the immersed boundary method (see below). These packages model fluid-structure interaction problems based on user given parameters and geometry. The manual creation of the initial geometry mesh can be difficult and time consuming, especially for the complex shapes encountered in biological applications. Oftentimes we have images of the geometry we wish to explore. I am developing software to help automate the creation of such CFD meshes for 2D simulations with a file-format suitable for use with IB2d and IBAMR from images.</description>

      <title>Tiny Insect Flight</title>

      <description>Winged insects are taxonomically diverse and inhabit virtually every terrestrial ecosystem on our planet. They range in size from the most minute insects, barely visible to the naked eye, to those with wingspans greater than 7 inches - larger than the palm of an adult human! With such diversity, insects provide a plethora of model organisms for investigating flight.
Students of biology are familiar with the fact that small bacteria tend to move differently than fish swim for example.</description>
