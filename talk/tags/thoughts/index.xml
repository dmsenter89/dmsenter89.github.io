      <description>The past few days I was at the Utah Math Bio Alumni Conference. It was great being back at my alma mater surrounded by so many talented mathematicians and scientists, but more on that next week when I&amp;rsquo;ll write about my conference experience (I&amp;rsquo;ll also be at SMB this week). What I want to write about today are some thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve had on chalk talks. Prior to their talks a lot of presenters took a few minutes to reminisce about their experiences with Utah math bio.</description>
