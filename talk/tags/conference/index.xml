      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back in North Carolina after an exciting week of conferences and meeting many new people working in mathematical biology throughout the world. It started with the Utah math bio alumni meeting in honor of Jim Keener&amp;rsquo;s 70th birthday, which I briefly mentioned last week, and was followed by SMB&amp;rsquo;s annual meeting. Both were held in Salt Lake City, UT. I really love being back in Utah, even if it&amp;rsquo;s only for a little while.</description>

      <description>The past few days I was at the Utah Math Bio Alumni Conference. It was great being back at my alma mater surrounded by so many talented mathematicians and scientists, but more on that next week when I&amp;rsquo;ll write about my conference experience (I&amp;rsquo;ll also be at SMB this week). What I want to write about today are some thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve had on chalk talks. Prior to their talks a lot of presenters took a few minutes to reminisce about their experiences with Utah math bio.</description>
