      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past month has been rather exciting due to a visit by OSU graduate student
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.appliedfluidslab.org/personnel/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vishwa Teja Kasoju&lt;/a&gt;. He is a student
in the Mechanical &amp;amp; Aerospace engineering PhD program as part of
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.appliedfluidslab.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Santhanakrishnan&amp;rsquo;s lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vishwa visited both UNC and Duke to get some footage of thrips flight and
Mantis shrimp escape behaviors. My undergraduate student Kristen Armel and I
assisted Vishwa in some of his thrips collecting and filming. It was a good
learning experience for us, as we learned how to work with the high speed cameras
we have on-site. We had good luck finding thrips around campus, escpecially a
day after it rained. Luckily there were plenty of rainy days in June, so we
had no shortage of specimen.&lt;/p&gt;
