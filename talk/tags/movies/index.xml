      <description>July 24th, 2010 was a normal day for most people. They got up in the morning, brushed their teeth and went about their business. For some, it may have been the best day of their life. For others, the worst. Some 6.9 billion people were alive on that day. Each with their own story, their own fears, their own dreams and challenges. Some were lucky and spent the day driving their sports car for fun or relaxing on a yacht.</description>
