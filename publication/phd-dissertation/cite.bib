abstract={All organisms must deal with fluid transport and interaction, whether it be internal, such as lungs moving air for the extraction of oxygen, or external, such as the expansion and contraction of a jellyfish bell for locomotion. Most organisms are highly deformable and their elastic deformations can be used to move fluid, move through fluid, and resist fluid forces. A particularly effective numerical method for biological fluid-structure interaction simulations is the immersed boundary (IB) method. An important feature of this method is that the fluid is discretized separately from the boundary interface, meaning that the two meshes do not need to conform with each other. This thesis covers the development of a new software tool for the semi-automated creation of finite difference meshes of complex 2D geometries for use with immersed boundary solvers IB2d and IBAMR, alongside two examples of locomotion - the flight of tiny insects and the metachronal paddling of brine shrimp.As mentioned, an advantage of the IB method is that complex geometries, e.g., internal or external morphology, can easily be handled without the need to generate matching grids for both the fluid and the structure. Consequently, the difficulty of modeling the structure lies often in discretizing the boundary of the complex geometry (morphology). Both commercial and open source mesh generators for finite element methods have long been established; however, the traditional immersed boundary method is based on a finite difference discretization of the structure. In chapter \ref{chap:meshmerizeme}, I present a software library called MeshmerizeMe for obtaining finite difference discretizations of boundaries for direct use in the 2D immersed boundary method. This library provides tools for extracting such boundaries as discrete mesh points from digital images. Several examples of how the method can be applied are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the software, including passing flow through the veins of insect wings, within lymphatic capillaries, and around starfish using open-source immersed boundary software.As an example of insect flight, I present a 3D model of clap and fling. Of the smallest insects filmed in flight, most if not all clap their wings together at the end of the upstroke and fling them apart at the beginning of the downstroke. This motion increases the strength of the leading edge vortices generated during the downstroke and augments the lift. At the Reynolds numbers ($Re$) relevant to flight in these insects (roughly $4 keywords={Biomathematics; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Applied mathematics; 0364:Applied Mathematics},
