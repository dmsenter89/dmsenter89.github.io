Hi! I'm Michael Senter, a PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. I'm part of the [Miller lab group](https://sites.google.com/site/swimflypump/home).
I'm interested in a variety of math physiology problems, including flight of the
smallest insects, neuromechanics, and plant electrophysiology.

I also enjoy coding with Python and C++. Some code I have written can be found on
Github page at
