      <description>&lt;p&gt;Winged insects are taxonomically diverse and inhibit virtually every terrestrial
ecosystem on our planet. They range in size from the most minute insects, barely
visible to the naked eye, to those with wingspans greater than 7 inches - larger
than the palm of an adult human! With such diversity, insects provide a plethora
 of model organisms for investigating flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students of biology are familiar with the fact that small bacteria tend to move
differently than fish swim for example. This is because a swimming motion is not
effective in moving you forward when you&amp;rsquo;re as small as a bacterium. But flagella
and celia will in fact move you forward effectively at that size. This difference
in behavior has to do with how the organism in question experiences the relative
effects of inertial and viscous forces. One way of quantifying the relative
importance of these effects is with the dimensionless quantity known as the
&lt;em&gt;Reynolds number&lt;/em&gt;; it is given by
$$\mathrm{Re}= \frac{\rho u L}{\mu},$$
where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in which the organism is moving, $u$ is
the velocity of the fluid with respect to the organism, $L$ is the &amp;ldquo;characteristic
length&amp;rdquo; of the organism, and $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. We and
many of the animals that we are familiar with from every day life live in a &amp;ldquo;high
Reynolds number world.&amp;rdquo; When we say high, we mean a value of Re in the thousands
and tens of thousands and higher. Bacteria on the other hand live in a low
Reynolds number world, with values on the order of $\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$. The
intermediate Reynolds number world is less well studied, and that&amp;rsquo;s where some
intersting stuff happens!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very small insects, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrips&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;thrips&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairyfly&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fairyflies&lt;/a&gt;, live in the intermediate
Reynolds number world. While larger insects typically create lift
by creating a leading edge vortex that remains attached to their wings, while a
trailing edge vortex is created and shed from the wing with each stroke. The tiny
insects on the other hand shed neither their trailing nor leading edge vortices,
and instead engage in what is known as clap-and-fling
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_flight#Aerodynamics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cf. here for some details&lt;/a&gt;).
Another interesting aspect of the flight of the smallest fliers is that their
wings show interesting adaptations. Most of us are familiar with the way
bee wings look. Even fruitflies have a very similar wing structure. Very tiny
fliers on the other hand will have relatively small wings with large bristles
attached to them, as in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dmsenter89.github.io/img/thrips.png&#34; alt=&#34;alternative text for search engines&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When gathering footage for previous work on clap-and-fling
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.084897&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Santhanakrishnan et al, 2014&lt;/a&gt;), we
also happened to come across footage showing parachuting behavior. Active flight
is energetically costly, especially if you want to go far. Passive flight
behaviors are an integral part of long-distance travel; just think of large
birds you may see circling on convection currents in the air. My work is on
trying to understand the aerodynamics of such passive flight behaviors in tiny
insects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;Mathematically, we can treat air as a fluid.

&lt;/ol&gt;
