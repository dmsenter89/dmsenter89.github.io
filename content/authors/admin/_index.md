Fluid dynamics modeling and simulations, data analysis, and machine learning have been the major themes of Michael's academic endeavors. The through line of his career has been the utilization of coding to solve computationally complex problems.

Michael enjoys mentoring and teaching. His teaching philosophy is based on his own experience - that a passion for math and computer science can be cultivated through active learning and emphasizing small victories. 

Michael is originally from Nuremberg, Germany where he attended the Neues Gymnasium Nuernberg, a school following the humanist tradition of education.  He now lives in Carrboro with his family, where he enjoys travelling, collecting books, and reading nerdy webcomics in his spare time.
