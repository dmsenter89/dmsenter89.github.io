    "After reading a news article about teacher pay in the US, I was curious and wanted to look into the source data myself. Unfortunately, the source that was mentioned was a publication by the [National Education Association (NEA)](https://www.nea.org/) which had the data as tables embedded inside a PDF report. As those who know me can attest, I don't like hand-copying data. It is slow and error-prone. Instead, I decided to use the tabula package to extract the information from the PDFs directly into a Pandas dataframe. In this post, I will show you how to extract the data and how to clean it up for analysis.\n",

    "Several years worth of data are available in PDF form on the [NEA website](https://www.nea.org/research-publications). Reading through the technical notes, they highlight that they did not collect all of their own salary information. Some states' information is calculated from the American Community Survey (ACS) done by the Census Bureau - a great resource whose API I have covered in a [different post]({{< ref \"/post/20-08-census-api/index.md\" >}}). Each report includes accurate data for the previous school year, as well as estimates for the current school year. As of this post, the newest report is the 2020 report which includes data for the the 2018-2019 school year, as well as estimates of the 2019-2020 school year.\n",

Since we want to use a URL, we will use the keyword argument `stream=True` and then name the specific page in each PDF that contains the information we are after. By default, `read_pdf` returns a list of dataframes, so we just save the first element from the list, which is the report we are interested in.\n",
