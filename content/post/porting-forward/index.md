My website is back up and running! Some incompatabilities between my old site and updates to both Hugo and the Academic Theme have led to some downtime on this page as I didn't have time to look through how to rebuild my site without loosing previous content. I'm currently in the process of updating everything and will try to bring back some material as well. Stay tuned!
