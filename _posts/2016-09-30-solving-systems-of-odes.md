Hi everyone -

since several of you had reported problems understanding how to implement a numerical solution of an ODE system in Matlab/Python, I went ahead and created a simple example script in both languages to solve the Lotka-Volterra system you had been shown in homework 5. The scripts are implemented in a PDF that breaks down the steps in creating the numerical solution. I hope this helps you in understanding how to solve general ODE systems numerically in Matlab or Python.
