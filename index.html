      Hi! I'm Michael. This is my git page. It's pretty empty and boring at this
      point, I know. But I'll be working on it this fall. It should be fun.
      I don't really know HTML too well atm, but it'll happen.

      In the end, it'd be nice to have this turn into a little professional page
      for me and my work. Currently I'm a graduate student in applied mathematics
      at <a href="http://www.unc.edu/">the University of North Carolina at Chapel
      Hill</a>. I'm with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/swimflypump/home">
      Miller lab group</a>.
