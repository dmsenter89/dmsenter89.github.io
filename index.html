      Hi! I'm Michael. This is my git page. It's pretty empty and boring at this
      point, I know. But I'll be working on it this fall. It should be fun.
      I don't really know HTML too well atm, but it'll happen.

      In the end, it'd be nice to have this turn into a little professional page
      for me and my work. Currently I'm a graduate student in applied mathematics
      at <a href="http://www.unc.edu/"><abbr title="University of North Carolina at Chapel
      Hill">UNC-CH</abbr></a>. I'm with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/swimflypump/home">
      Miller lab group</a>. My GitHub profile can be found <a href="https://github.com/dmsenter89">here</a>.
