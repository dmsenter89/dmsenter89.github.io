      <title>Chalk Talks and Plots</title>
      <link>https://dmsenter89.github.io/post/20170716_chalk_talks/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2017 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dmsenter89.github.io/post/20170716_chalk_talks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past few days I was at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.utah.edu/research/mathbio/workshops/UtahAlumConference.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Utah Math Bio Alumni Conference&lt;/a&gt;.
It was great being back at my &lt;em&gt;alma mater&lt;/em&gt; surrounded by so many talented
mathematicians and scientists, but more on that next week when I&amp;rsquo;ll write about
my conference experience (I&amp;rsquo;ll also be at SMB this week). What I want to write
about today are some thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve had on chalk talks. Prior to their talks a lot
of presenters took a few minutes to reminisce about their experiences with Utah math bio.
The quality of physiology group meetings came up several times. At one point, someone
(I think it was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cytryn/index.shtml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Eric Cytrynbaum&lt;/a&gt;)
mentioned how it was difficult nowadays to get students to use the board during
group meetings when everyone has a laptop and uses powerpoints and computer-generated
plots. That got me thinking and wondering when I&amp;rsquo;ve had my last &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; chalk talk.
And it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely true in my experience that we&amp;rsquo;ve become
very reliant on powerpoints and beamer presentations. And I have to say I miss chalk
talks. When I was a senior at Utah I took an intro to applied math course
with Dr. Cherkaev that required us to present a final project on a topic of our
choosing. I remember being the only one in the course &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; using a powerpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like chalk talks and I think being good at chalk talks is a
great skill to have. And it&amp;rsquo;s especially important for graduate students. We don&amp;rsquo;t
have a lot of papers out yet, with us being early in our career and all. But
we have ideas and enthusiasm. Actively writing your work down while you discuss it
with peers is a great way to communicate that enthusiasm. And
this is frankly one area where I feel that pure math students tend to have a leg
up on applied students. Or at least the one&amp;rsquo;s I know. One-on-one meetings with
their advisors tend to involve blackboard work or going over handwritten pages.
Applied students? Open your laptop, show some code and or graphs, what have you.
Not that there is anything wrong with that. It just leads to us having less
practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the appeals of computer aided presentation is that we can use graphs and
images. In science we often have cool images and nice graphs and we love
showing them off. But whether or not it is important to show someone these
particular visuals depends on what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to accomplish.
I&amp;rsquo;m not arguing we should do chalk talks at
conference presentations. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking more of informal settings such as lab meetings
or just getting together with peers in the department lounge. In such informal
situations, what I am generally trying to accomplish is give my peers a high level
overview of what I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing, what challenges I may face and what results
I got. And if I have plots, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect them to notice anything very precise.
In general I&amp;rsquo;m trying to point out some qualitative behavior of interest. And that
frankly does not require me firing up matplotlib or a draft of a paper I&amp;rsquo;m
writing. Qualitative behavior lends itself to back-of-the-envelope plotting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XKCD is a great example of just how effectivey seemingly &amp;ldquo;crude&amp;rdquo; plots and charts
can be. &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/1319/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an example:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png&#34; alt=&#34;XKCD Graph&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets the point across. Humor in this case, but the same can be done with research.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of us have done it at some point; perhaps at a bar on a napkin with
their peers after a conference. And it&amp;rsquo;s exciting and fun. I feel it draws
the audience in more than searching through your phone for some nice plot you made.
Doing this type of presentation more often would be refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nickabattista/IB2d&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IB2d&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/IBAMR/IBAMR&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IBAMR&lt;/a&gt; are two software packages implementing
the immersed boundary method (see below). These packages model fluid-structure
interaction problems based on user given parameters and geometry. The manual
creation of the initial geometry mesh can be difficult and time consuming,
especially for the complex shapes encountered in biological applications.
Oftentimes we have images of the geometry we wish to explore.
I am developing software to help automate the creation of such CFD meshes for
2D simulations with a file-format suitable for use with IB2d and IBAMR from
images. An initial prototype version is available on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dmsenter89/MeshmerizeMe&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. A paper
exploring the use of MeshmerizeMe in conjuction with IB2d for simulations is
in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage&#34;&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MeshmerizeMe needs two input files per experimental geometry: an SVG image file
with the geometry of interest and an input2d file with the experiment parameters.
When selecting an SVG for use with MeshmerizeMe it will automatically look for
the input2d file in the same folder. It will then parse the paths, transform
them into the correct coordinate system and appropriately sample the paths based
on the size of the Cartesian grid set in the input2d file. The geometry will be
exported as a vertex file. This file is readable by both IB2d and IBAMR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SVGs were chosen as the image source as the are an open, text-based format
making them very accesible to work with. They are standardized for web use and
many tools exist for creating and manipulating SVG images. They can be created
from source images such as photographs or scans by means of edge detection tools
and by manually tracing the outline of a shape of interest
Consider optimizing the SVG prior to processing to save time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the current version of MeshmerizeMe only handles a subset of SVG, tools that
optimize the SVG files created by your editor are very useful. Examples of such
software include  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/svg/svgo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SVGO&lt;/a&gt;, which also offers a
webapp  called &lt;a href=&#34;https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SVGOMG&lt;/a&gt;.
Another software is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/RazrFalcon/svgcleaner&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;svgcleaner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ibm-background&#34;&gt;IBM Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One aspect of computational fluid dynamics is the investigation of&lt;br /&gt;
fluid-structure interactions. One method developed for the study of such
interactions is the immersed boundary method (IBM) developed by Peskin&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
It is well known that fluids can be studied from both a Eulerian and a
Lagrangian view. The IBM combines these - the domain of the problem is resolved
as a Cartesian grid on which Eulerian equations are solved for fluid velocity
and pressure. In the case of Newtonian fluids the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations comprising of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$ \rho  \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} \right)  = - \nabla \mathbf{p} + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;need to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immersed structures are modeled as fibers in the form of parametric
curves $X(s,t)$, where $s$ is a parameter and $t$ is time. The fiber experiences
force distributions $F(s,t)$, and we can derive the force the fiber exerts on
the fluid from the momentum equation. For the fibers we then solve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\mathbf{f} = \int_\Gamma \mathbf{F}(s,t)\,\delta\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{X}(s,t)\right)\,ds$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{\partial \mathbf{X}}{\partial t} = \int_\Omega \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t)\, \delta \left( \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{X}(s,t)\right)\,d\mathbf{x}.$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, $\Gamma$ is the immersed structure and $\Omega$ is the fluid domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immersed structures are discretized not on a Cartesian grid but on a
separate Lagrangian grid on the fiber itself. Of import to CFD software users
is that the initial discretization of the immersed structure has to be
supplied by the user. While this is not too difficult for simple geometries,
the often complex structures encountered in mathematical biology can present
a significant time investment. This is the part where MeshmerizeMe comes in
handy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Filming Thrips with Vishwa</title>
      <link>https://dmsenter89.github.io/post/20170702-filming-with-vishwa/</link>

      <guid>https://dmsenter89.github.io/post/20170702-filming-with-vishwa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past month has been rather exciting due to a visit by OSU graduate student
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.appliedfluidslab.org/personnel/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vishwa Teja Kasoju&lt;/a&gt;. He is a student
in the Mechanical &amp;amp; Aerospace engineering PhD program as part of
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.appliedfluidslab.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Santhanakrishnan&amp;rsquo;s lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vishwa visited both UNC and Duke to get some footage of thrips flight and
Mantis shrimp escape behaviors. My undergraduate student Kristen Armel and I
assisted Vishwa in some of his thrips collecting and filming. It was a good
learning experience for us, as we learned how to work with the high speed cameras
we have on-site. We had good luck finding thrips around campus, escpecially a
day after it rained. Luckily there were plenty of rainy days in June, so we
had no shortage of specimen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tiny Insect Flight</title>
      <link>https://dmsenter89.github.io/project/tiny-insects/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dmsenter89.github.io/project/tiny-insects/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Winged insects are taxonomically diverse and inhabit virtually every terrestrial
ecosystem on our planet. They range in size from the most minute insects, barely
visible to the naked eye, to those with wingspans greater than 7 inches - larger
than the palm of an adult human! With such diversity, insects provide a plethora
 of model organisms for investigating flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students of biology are familiar with the fact that small bacteria tend to move
differently than fish swim for example. This is because a swimming motion is not
effective in moving you forward when you&amp;rsquo;re as small as a bacterium. But flagella
and celia will in fact move you forward effectively at that size. This difference
in behavior has to do with how the organism in question experiences the relative
effects of inertial and viscous forces. One way of quantifying the relative
importance of these effects is with the dimensionless quantity known as the
&lt;em&gt;Reynolds number&lt;/em&gt;; it is given by
$$\mathrm{Re}= \frac{\rho u L}{\mu},$$
where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in which the organism is moving, $u$ is
the velocity of the fluid with respect to the organism, $L$ is the &amp;ldquo;characteristic
length&amp;rdquo; of the organism, and $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. We and
many of the animals that we are familiar with from every day life live in a &amp;ldquo;high
Reynolds number world.&amp;rdquo; When we say high, we mean a value of Re in the thousands
and tens of thousands and higher. Bacteria on the other hand live in a low
Reynolds number world, with values on the order of $\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$. The
intermediate Reynolds number world is less well studied, and that&amp;rsquo;s where some
interesting stuff happens!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very small insects, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrips&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;thrips&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairyfly&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fairyflies&lt;/a&gt;, live in the intermediate
Reynolds number world. While larger insects typically create lift
by creating a leading edge vortex that remains attached to their wings, while a
trailing edge vortex is created and shed from the wing with each stroke. The tiny
insects on the other hand shed neither their trailing nor leading edge vortices,
and instead engage in what is known as clap-and-fling
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_flight#Aerodynamics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cf. here for some details&lt;/a&gt;).
Another interesting aspect of the flight of the smallest fliers is that their
wings show interesting adaptations. Most of us are familiar with the way
bee wings look. Even fruitflies have a very similar wing structure. Very tiny
fliers on the other hand will have relatively small wings with large bristles
attached to them, as in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dmsenter89.github.io/img/thrips.png&#34; alt=&#34;alternative text for search engines&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When gathering footage for previous work on clap-and-fling
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.084897&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Santhanakrishnan et al, 2014&lt;/a&gt;), we
also happened to come across footage showing parachuting behavior. Active flight
is energetically costly, especially if you want to go far. Passive flight
behaviors are an integral part of long-distance travel; just think of large
birds you may see circling on convection currents in the air. My work is on
trying to understand the aerodynamics of such passive flight behaviors in tiny
insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;Mathematically, we can treat air as a fluid.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
